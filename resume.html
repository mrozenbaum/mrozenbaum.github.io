                          <p>Is a SPA built with <b>AngularJS</b> for a client who's services include eyelash extension certification training and various realted beauty products. I used <b>Firebase</b> to authenticate users, and store user information, providing the user with the ability to create a profile and save their products or training information for a later time. Users can contact the company via a simple form, social links, or phone. I was given a strict 'style bible' to go by. Specific colors, styles, and company logos. I achiveved the clients needs using <b>Bootstrap</b> and <b>CSS.</b> In the end, I refactored and redesigned this project to be more "client friendly" by hard coding the code into a <b>Wordpress</b> theme and making it easier for the client to access and update on the fly. The company and website have been live since April 2017.</p>
